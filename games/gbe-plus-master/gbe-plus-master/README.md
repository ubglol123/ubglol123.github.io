# gbe-plus

GB Enhanced+ is a DMG/GBC/GBA/Pokemon Mini emulator and experimental NDS emulator. It is the successor to the original GB Enhanced project with a focus on emulating as much of the Game Boy as possible, including various peripherals and accessories.

## Overview

GB Enhanced+ (GBE+ for short) aims to be a fully functional Game Boy emulator. The goal is to create a highly portable emulator using C++ and SDL and document the Game Boy's functions through clear code. Additionally GBE+ strives to emulate everything about the Game Boy, including obscure hardware and features.

## Compiling GBE+

The only requirements at this moment are SDL 2.0, OpenGL 3.3 or greater, a C++ compiler, and CMake. Qt (for the GUI) and SDL2_net (for netplay) are optional dependencies. GLEW is a Windows-only mandatory dependency.

## READ THE MANUAL

GBE+ comes with very nice PDF and ODT manuals explaining everything about its operation, and devotes extensive time to covering complex topics such as setting up netplay, enabling rumble support or motion controls, and more. PLEASE READ THE MANUAL if you have any questions regarding this emulator.
